# Django based Art Exhibition Website

I have used TailwindCSS CDN in this site's frontend, so you will require an active internet connection for good experience while working on this repo.



The site was made for college fest, so while using it for any other purpose, it is strictly advised to not to use any of the images, logos and symbols in this repo while deploying this for your project or any other purpose.
